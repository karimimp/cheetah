In this repo, I keep my notes from reading [Numerical Python
Scientific Computing and Data Science Applications with Numpy, SciPy and 
Matplotlib](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484242452). There is also a 
[repository](https://github.com/Apress/numerical-python-second-ed) with all the 
related code examples in the book. Yet, I keep the stuff that are more practical
for my day-to-day tasks.
